# Blank Required Plugins #

## Description ##

External plugins loader with TGM Plugin Activation library.

This is a "meta-plugin". It allows to show a list of useful plugins (for me)
in different situations: development, production, debug, ecommerce.

## Configuration ##

After installing go to Settings -> "Blank Plugins" and choose the "situation".

If you have chosen at least one entry, and the required plugins aren't installed
and/or active, in the menu Plugins -> "Install Plugins" you will find the list,
so you can choose which one to install and/or activate.

## Changelog ##

### 1.0 ####

* Initial release

## Note ##

This plugin is for my personal use.
